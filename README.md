 Cancer Patients Severity Prediction (Machine Learning Project)
📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on building a Machine Learning regression model to predict the Target Severity Score of cancer patients using a global healthcare dataset.
The goal is to analyze patient health factors such as genetic risk, smoking habits, environmental exposure, and cancer stage to understand their impact on disease severity.
